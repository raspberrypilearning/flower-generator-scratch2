## Flower patterns

You can also use your `draw flower`{:class="blockmoreblocks"} block to create neat flower patterns. 

--- task ---

Create a flower or a combination of flowers that you like. Here's an example:

![flower sprite](images/flower-sprite.png)

![blocks_1545217544_0587213](images/blocks_1545217544_0587213.png)

--- /task ---

--- task ---

Press <kbd>p</kbd> to see your flower. The example looks like this:

![a flower pattern](images/flower-for-pattern-example.png)  

--- /task ---

Before you can create your pattern, you should clear the Stage of any leftover flowers.

--- task ---

Click on the `clear` block in the Pen tab.

--- /task ---

--- task ---

Right-click on the Flower sprite and `hide`{:class="blocklooks"} it so it doesn't appear on the Stage. (You can `show`{:class="blocklooks"} the sprite again if you need to see where it is.)

--- /task ---

--- task ---

Now draw a row of these flowers across the top of the Stage. Here is some example code, in which you might need to adjust the numbers so it work with your flower:

![flower sprite](images/flower-sprite.png)

![blocks_1545217546_2469552](images/blocks_1545217546_2469552.png)

--- /task ---

--- task ---

Press `p` to see a row of flowers: 

![4 flowers in a row](images/flower-pattern-row-example.png)

--- /task ---

--- task ---

Add another loop to create more rows of flowers. This example adds a `repeat 3`{:class="blockcontrol"} loop to create three rows.

--- /task ---

--- task ---

Press <kbd>p</kbd> to create a grid of flowers: 

![a 4 x 4 grid of flowers](images/flower-pattern-rows-example.png)

--- /task ---

Do you want to speed up the drawing of the flowers? 

--- task ---
Right-click on the `draw flower`{:class="blockmoreblocks"} definition block and then click on **edit**. Click on the **Run without screen refresh** box. 

![turn no refresh option off](images/flower-no-refresh.png)

Now the flowers get drawn more quickly. 

--- /task ---

You can also change the colour of the Stage.

--- task ---

Click on **Paint new backdrop**. Create an orange backdrop by using the Fill tool in Bitmap mode. 

![paint new backdrop](images/flower-orange-backdrop.png)

If you use orange for the backdrop and the Flower sprite, then the numbers for different colours will match for the sprite and the backdrop. 

--- /task ---

--- task ---

Now you can use the `set colour effect`{:class="blocklooks"} on the Stage to change the colour of the backdrop.

![stage sprite](images/stage-sprite.png)

![blocks_1545217548_5060186](images/blocks_1545217548_5060186.png)

--- /task ---

--- task ---

Try to create a pattern you like. 

Here's an example: 
 
![flowers on a green background](images/flower-pattern-background.png)
 
--- /task ---

When you put it all together, you can create an amazing effect:
