Can you modify the `when the r key is pressed`{:class="blockevents"} script so the flowers' size and number of petals are also random?

--- hints ---

--- hint ---

The `draw flower`{:class="blockmoreblocks"} block should `pick random`{:class="blockoperators"} numbers for the size and number of petals.

--- /hint ---

--- hint ---

The following blocks pick a random size between `50` and `150` and a random number of petals between `4` and `12`.
